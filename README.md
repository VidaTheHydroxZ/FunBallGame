# Pong Game Clone

## Pong Game
Have fun and play some Pong! :) 

## Overview
This repository contains all the files necessary to run the Pong Game. 
The game was made entirely in C programming language using only SDL libraries for now.
SDL Library was used to create a window, render stuff on the screen as well as produce cool sounds!

## Game Controls
Use W and S on keyboard to move Player 1 & O and L to move Player2 up and down.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo!
Open whatever CLI/Command Prompt you are using and make sure you have gcc (minGW) installed.
Position yourself to the project directory and type "make" followed by "make run" to start the game.
Typing "make clean" will remove the .exe and all SDL*.dll files from the repo folder.
